# Ultralight Fortran Stack - Frontend Calculator

**Short Description:** A lightweight frontend calculator deployed via GitHub Pages; Fortran integration planned.

---

## Overview

This repository hosts a **simple HTML5 + Bootstrap calculator** deployed via **GitHub Pages**.  
At this stage, the calculator is purely **client-side JavaScript**, and **no Fortran runtime is executed**.  

The project demonstrates a **fully contained GitHub workflow**:

- Frontend code lives in the `frontend/` folder
- Deployment is automated via **GitHub Actions**
- The `gh-pages` branch is automatically created and updated
- Custom domain support with CNAME is included

## GitHub Actions Deployment

The deployment workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) automatically:

1. Checks out the repository.
2. Publishes `frontend/` contents to the `gh-pages` branch.
3. Creates/updates a `CNAME` file for the custom domain `ded-beat-boutique.com`.
4. Runs entirely within GitHub—no local build or external hosting is required.

**Key points:**

- `gh-pages` branch is auto-generated by the workflow.
- Workflow uses a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** for private repo deployment (if private).
- The deployed site is **public**, even though the repository remains private.

## Current Status

- Calculator is fully working at:  
  - [http://ded-beat-boutique.com](http://ded-beat-boutique.com)  
  - [http://www.ded-beat-boutique.com](http://www.ded-beat-boutique.com)
- Static frontend only; Fortran integration is not yet implemented.
- Repository and workflow demonstrate a **pure GitHub-contained CI/CD deployment**.

---

## Fortran Testing / Future Integration

- The `fortran/` folder is reserved for **Fortran source code**.  
- Options for future integration:
  1. **Backend API**: Flask or another server runs Fortran executables and serves results via HTTP.  
  2. **WebAssembly (WASM)**: Compile Fortran to WASM for client-side computation.  
  3. **Precomputed tables**: Generate results offline with Fortran and embed in JS.  

- This ensures future Fortran functionality can be added **without disrupting the current frontend workflow**.

---

## Next Steps

1. Implement **Fortran integration** (backend API or WebAssembly).  
2. Optionally set up **server-side deployment** for dynamic calculations.  
3. Expand frontend features (Bootstrap enhancements, additional calculators).

---

## Notes

- GitHub Pages cannot execute Fortran directly; only static files are served.  
- All updates to `frontend/` are automatically deployed to `gh-pages` via Actions.  
- Keep commits to the `main` branch; workflow triggers on every push.
